# Chapter 2. Vector Space 

## 2.1 V.S / Sub Space 

Space = set closed(포함되다, $$\in$$) under addition & sclar multiplication

1. x+y = y +x
2. x + (y +z ) = (x+y)+z
3. there is a zero-vector 
4. For each vector X, 
    - X + (-X) = (-X) + X = 0
5. 1 * X = X
6. c(X+Y) = cX + cY 
7. (c1 + c2)X = C1X + C2X
